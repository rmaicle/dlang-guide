D programming language is a general purpose [systems programming language] which belongs to the [C-family languages].
It is a rich programming language supporting multiple powerful [programming paradigms]; imperative, object-oriented, functional and meta-programming.
It is an expressive language integrating pragmatic features and making them cohesively elegant to write and understand.

The D programming language design goals has a tall order.
D combines competing requirements for efficiency, control, modeling power, safety and productivity.
D promotes the principle of make correct code easier to write and wrong code harder.
