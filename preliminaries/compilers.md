The D language have 3 official compilers available.
For more in-depth information about the availability of these compilers, please visit [http://wiki.dlang.org/Compilers](http://wiki.dlang.org/Compilers).

Digital Mars D
: The Digital Mars D compiler  is the reference compiler for the D programming language.
  This is the compiler created by Walter Bright from the 1990s when he called it the _Mars_ programming language.

  The reference compiler is available on different platforms; Microsoft Windows, Linux and OS X.
  It is officially available to some Linux distribution like Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora/CentOS, openSUSE and FreeBSD.
  For other Linux distributions, please check their repositories for the availability of D language compilers.

GDC (GNU D Compiler)
: GDC is a GPL implementation of the D compiler which integrates the open source D front end with GCC.
  It was originally started by David Friedman in 2004 until 2007.
  Development is now under Iain Buclaw.

  GDC have official packages available for Arch Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu.
  There are also binaries for 32/64-bit Linux for x86 and ARM, and Microsoft Windows for x86.

LDC (LLVM-based D Compiler)
: LDC is an open source D compiler that relies on the LLVM core libraries for code generation.
  LDC is still in the works.
  As of November 2015, LDC project status reports that LDC works fine on most x86/x86-64 Unix-like systems, OS X 10.7+, Solaris and most BSD flavors.
