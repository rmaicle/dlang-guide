### Unary Operators Overview

| Operator     | Group      | Description |
|:------------:|:----------:|-------------|
| ++           | arithmetic | pre-increment |
| ++           | arithmetic | post-increment |
| --           | arithmetic | pre-decrement |
| --           | arithmetic | post-decrement |



| ~ (tilde)    | arithmetic | bitwise complement |
| +            | arithmetic | unary plus |
| -            | arithmetic | unary minus |
| -            | arithmetic | negation |

| !            | logical | post-decrement |


### Binary Operators Overview

Binary operators are operators that work with two (2) operands and produces a result.
There are two (2) groups of binary operators; logical and arithmetic binary operators.
Logical binary operators are operators that are used to evaluate its operands and produces a boolean value.
Arithmetic binary operators are operators that are used to compute its operands and produces a mathematical or numeric value.

The following table shows these operators.

| Operator     | Group    | Description |
|:------------:|:--------:|-------------|
| ==           | relational | equality |
| !=           | relational  | inequality |
| <            | relational  | less than |
| >            | relational  | greater than |
| >=           | relational  | greater than or equal to |
| <=           | relational  | less than or equal to |
| &&           | relational  | logical AND |
| &#124;&#124; | relational  | logical OR |

| &#52;        | arithmetic | multiplication |
| /            | arithmetic | division |
| +            | arithmetic | addition |
| -            | arithmetic | subtraction |
| %            | arithmetic | modulus |

| &            |            | bitwise AND |
| |            |            | bitwise inclusive OR |
| ^            |            | exclusive OR |

| ,            |            | comma |
| =            |            | assignment |
