[Walter Bright] started working on a new programming language back in the 1990s.
For Walter, this is nothing new.
He has been implementing compilers for many years.
He called it __Mars__ but people keep referring to it as __D__, a successor to the [C Programming Language].
<span class="hide">Walter named his new programming language __Mars__ but the community around it keeps calling it __D__.</span>

D was [first released](http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/changelog1.html#new000) in December 2001.
[Andrei Alexandrescu] joined the language design team in 2006 and has contributed much to what the language is now.
Andrei left Facebook this year to work on D full-time, which, I think, is a very bold move.
And following that, the D Language Foundation is now incorporated.

What an exciting time for D!
