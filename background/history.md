[Walter Bright] started working on a new programming language back in the 1990s.
For Walter, this is nothing new.
He has been implementing compilers for many years.
He called it _Mars_ but people keep referring to it as _D_, a successor to the [C Programming Language].

D was [first released](http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/changelog1.html#new000) in December 2001.

[Andrei Alexandrescu] joined the language design team in 2006 and has contributed much to what the language is now.
Andrei left Facebook in 2015 to work fulltime on the development of the language.
Andrei is now officially addressed as the D Language Architect.

The D Language Foundation is officially incorporated on October 18, 2015 to help fund and further the development of the language.

The reference compiler [version 2.069.0](http://dlang.org/changelog/2.069.0.html), released on November 3, 2015 is now a self-hosting compiler.
Meaning, it is now used to compiler and build itself.

What an exciting time for D!
