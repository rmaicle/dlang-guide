D has some noteable features.
Some of these features may have been present in other languages before D has implemented them.
There are also powerful features that are unique to the language.
The language makes these features work together almost seamlessly that it sometimes makes proggramming in D so effortlessly simple.

* Large-scale programming through the use of _modules_.
* Language support for _conditional compilation_ for versioning, debugging and compile time code evaluation and assertion.
* _Contract programming_ aids programmers in code correctness of functions and classes using pre/post condition checking and invariants.
* Built-in language support for _unit testing_.
* Built-in language support for the powerful _scope-based RAII_ (Resource Acquisition is Initialization).
* _Arrays_ are built into the language and not a library implementation paving the way to native language support for _dynamic_ and _associative arrays_ and _array slicing_.
* Nested Functions - 
* Inner Classes
* Closures
* Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions)
* _Compile-time function execution_ allows code to be executed during compilation which opens new and powerful capabilities.
* Lazy Evaluation
* Mixins
* _Inline assembler_ for low-level systems programming.
