D programming language is a general purpose [systems programming language] which belongs to the [C-family languages].
It is a rich programming language supporting multiple powerful [programming paradigms]; imperative, object-oriented, contract programming, functional and meta-programming.
It is an expressive language integrating pragmatic features that work cohesively elegant.

The D programming language design goals has a tall order.
D combines competing requirements for efficiency, control, modeling power, safety and productivity.
D promotes the principle of making correct code easier and wrong code harder to write.
