# dlang-guide

This is a guide to the D Programming Language.
It has been recently started so lots of information may be missing or inaccurate.

These repository are sources for http://rmaicle.github.io/dlang-guide/index.html.
The sources are used with GitHub pages and may not be purely written in markdown syntax.

I intend to use the sources to produce other file formats using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/).
One problem I find is that there are some HTML code embedded in the sources so that they are rendered correctly in GitHub Pages.
One solution is to feed the converted HTML files to Pandoc to produce purely markdown files and from there other formats can be generated but I haven't tried it yet.

## This is a work in progress.
