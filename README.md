# dlang-guide

This is a guide to the D Programming Language.
It has been recently started so lots of information may be missing or inaccurate.

The intended audience for this reference work are beginners to programming and experienced programmers learning the D programming language.
So, emphasis is on explaining details in simplistic terms for those new to programming and provide good enough information to those moving into the D language.

### Sources

This repository contains sources for http://rmaicle.github.io/dlang-guide/index.html.
The sources are used with GitHub pages and may not be purely written in markdown syntax.

I also intend to use the sources to produce other file formats using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) for distribution.
One problem I find is that there are some HTML codes embedded in the sources to make them work correctly under GitHub Pages.
One solution I see, for now, is to feed the converted HTML files to Pandoc to produce purely markdown files and from there other formats can be generated.

### This is a work in progress.

There is not timeline yet for this project.
The primairy concern now is to provide the most basic information on chapters and sections and from there expound on the topics.
