Input source files are text files passed to and read by the compiler.
D supports the [_ASCII_] and [_Unicode_] text file formats and understands any Unicode character.

An ASCII text file is read starting with the first character in the file but not so with Unicode text files.
Because Unicode text files have different _character encodings_ [^charencode] and deals with different machine endianness [^endianness], Unicode text files have an identification system to to determine and read the files correctly.
This identification system is embedded in the first bytes of a text file and defined by Unicode as the _Byte Order Mark_ (BOM).
The compiler reads the BOM and converts the contents of the file to Unicode characters.

| Format   | BOM | Location |
|----------|-----|----------|
| ASCII    | none (first character must be <= U+0000007F) | none |
| UTF-8    | EF BB BF | first 3 bytes |
| UTF-16BE | FE FF | first 2 bytes |
| UTF-16LE | FF FE | first 2 bytes |
| UTF-32BE | 00 00 FE FF | first 4 bytes |
| UTF-32LE | FF FE 00 00 | first 4 bytes |

###### ASCII
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a character-encoding scheme which was developed from telegraphic codes promoted by Bell data services.
The first edition of the ASCII standard was published in 1963 and revisions went on until 1986.[^ascii_pub]
The ASCII character set was later incorporated into the Unicode character set without changing their codes to allow backwards compatibility. [^ascii_unicode]

###### Unicode
Unicode is an industry standard for text encoding for the world's writing system.
The most recent version is [Unicode 8.0](http://blog.unicode.org/2015/06/announcing-unicode-standard-version-80.html) as of November 2015.
Unicode defines two mapping methods: the _Unicode Transformation Format_ (UTF) encodings, and the _Universal Character Set_ (UCS) encodings.
There are other UTF encodings other than those mentioned here.

[^charencode]: Character encodings are a way to unify different character sets of the world's writing systems to facilitate the interchange of digital text.
[^endianness]: Machine endianness refers to the way a computer processor stores data. Technically, it is the way a computer processor stores the most significant _bits_. If the most significant bits are stored first then this is called the _Big-Endian_ (BE) and the other way would be _Little-Endian_ (LE).

##### Separators and Terminators

Scanning the source text 
Token separators for simplicity are 

| Name              | Unicode         | ASCII           | Char | Remark |
|-------------------|:---------------:|:---------------:|:----:|--------|
| End of File (EOF) | U+0000          | 00 0x00         | \\0     | Null (NUL) |
|                   | U+001A          | 26 0x1A         |         | Substitute (SUB) |
| End of Line (EOL) | U+000A          | 10 0x0A         |  \\n    | Line Feed (LF) |
|                   | U+000D          | 13 0x0D         |  \\r    | Carriae Return (CR) |
|                   | U+000D + U+000A | 13+10 0x0D+0x0A | \\r\\n  | CR+LF |
|                   | U+2028          |                 |         | Line Separator |
|                   | U+2029          |                 |         | Paragraph Separator |
|                   |                 |                 |         | End of File (EOF) |
| Whitespace        | U+0009          | 09 0x09         |  \\t    | Horiontal tab (TAB) |
|                   | U+000B          | 11 0x0B         |  \\v    | Vertcal tab (VT) |
|                   | U+000C          | 12 0x0C         |  \\f    | New Page Form Feed (NP, FF) |
|                   | U+0020          | 32 0x20         | (space) | Space |

##### Backslash Line Splicing

Backslash line splicing is used in programming languages like C++ to join two or more lines.
Line splicing treats the concerned lines as if they are a single line.
D does not recognize backslash line splicing but the language does not limit the number of characters of a source code line.
