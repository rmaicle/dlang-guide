Floating point literals are a series of consecutive characters that the compiler interprets as a floating point type.
Floating point literals can be in decimal or hexadecimal formats.
Floating point literal suffixes tell the compiler that a certain floating point literal belongs to a certain group.
Floating point literals uses the same digit separators as integer literals.

> It is an error if the literal exceeds the range of the type. It is not an error if the literal is rounded to fit into the significant digits of the type.

> Complex literals are not tokens, but are assembled from real and imaginary expressions during semantic analysis:

> ~~~{d}
> 4.5 + 6.2i      // complex number (phased out)
> ~~~
