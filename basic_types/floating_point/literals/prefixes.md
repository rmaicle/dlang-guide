Floating point literals can be in decimal or hexadecimal formats and follows the same prefixes as in integer literals.
Floating point literals have a prefix which is used to define exponents.
Although this prefix can only be used with hexadecimal floating point literal.
The letter `p` or `P` followed by a decimal number serves as the exponent of `2`.

> Hexadecimal floats are preceded by a 0x or 0X and the exponent is a p or P followed by a decimal number serving as the exponent of 2.
