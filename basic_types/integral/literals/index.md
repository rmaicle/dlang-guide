Integer literals are a series of consecutive characters that the compiler interprets as an integral type.
Literal prefixes tell the compiler that a certain integer literal is of a certain number system aside from the default decimal number system.
Literal suffixes tell the compiler that a certain integer literal belongs to a certain group like signed, unsigned.
Literal digit separators are used for formatting integer literals.
