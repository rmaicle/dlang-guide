The _American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)_ is a character-encoding scheme which was developed from telegraphic codes promoted by Bell data services.
The first edition of the ASCII standard was published in 1963 and revisions went on until 1986.[^ascii_pub]
The ASCII character set was later incorporated into the _Unicode_ character set without changing their codes to allow backwards compatibility. [^ascii_unicode]

The ASCII control codes and printable codes are reproduced here for reference.
