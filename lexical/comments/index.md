A comment is a kind of program annotation. It is primarily used to add information about a piece of code that cannot be expressed using the language.
As in other programming languages, comments are ignored or discarded by the compiler and may be placed anywhere in the source text.
D inherits the C and C++ style comments (_block_ and _line_ comments) and added a _nesting block_ comment style.

The following is the syntax summary of comment styles:

| Name          | Begin | End   | 
|---------------|:-----:|:-----:|
| Line          | `//`  |       | 
| Block         | `/*`  | `*/`  | 
| Nesting Block | `/+`  | `+/`  |
