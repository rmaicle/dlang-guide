Also sometimes called inline comments are comments that span only in the line it is on.
A line comment starts with double slash (`//`) characters. Any characters on the same line after it is ignored.
It is used as an alternative to the block comment when a single line is involved obviously because it is easier to type.
Programmers sometimes prefer to type less for single line comments.

{% highlight d %}
// This is a line comment
{% endhighlight %}
